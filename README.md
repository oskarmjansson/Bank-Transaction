# Bank transaction

This code is a simple project to get an API with a list of fictitious transactions and display it depending on how the user prefers. 


## Description

By using MVC these transactions can be viewed by by entering the transaction menu. There you can also store rules of how you want to group transaction. For example you can store rules that every transaction labeled "Ica" and "Coop" will have the category as food. Then a summary of all the transactions and the users grouped transaction can be displayed.
