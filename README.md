# Bank transaction

This project utilizes an API containing a list of fictitious transactions and displays them according to the user's preferences.

## Description

By employing the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, users can access the transactions by navigating to the transaction menu. Within this menu, users have the option to define rules for grouping transactions according to their preferences. 

For instance, users can establish rules such that transactions labeled as 'Ica' and 'Coop' are categorized as food. Subsequently, both a summary of all transactions and the user-defined grouped transactions can be displayed.
